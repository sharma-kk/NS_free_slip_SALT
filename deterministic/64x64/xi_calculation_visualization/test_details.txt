We are recording (u-u_avg) data from high res. simulations.
We load the high res. vel from .h5 files, coarse-grain it and
then record (u-u_avg). 
We also record the value of coarse-grained velocity at certain
observation points (we have 9 points)
The data is stored as .npz files. 
t_start = 50, t_end = 100
We store the coarse-grained velocity data at an interval of 
1 time unit. 

I am also saving the coarse grained fields as .pvd files and KE data as .txt file. 
The .pvd file contain data till t = 99 although the name is till t =100 (same for KE)
According to initial estimates, it takes roughly  25 minutes to record data for 
1 time unit. 
Total estimated sim. time ~ 1253 minutes. 

Note that the coarse-grained vel. data will be stored till t = 99 and the 
(u-u_avg) data is stored till t=99.9

## I made a mistake. I should have collected the data till t = 110 but i saved it till t = 100

###########coarse_graining_residual_disp_calc_t100_to_t110.py########
doing the above procedure from t =100 to t = 110
I saved the coarse grained vel data at observation points in the
folder: coarse_grained_vel_data. 
I should have probably renamed the folder to: coarse_grained_vel_data_at_obs_points
since the above name is misleading.
