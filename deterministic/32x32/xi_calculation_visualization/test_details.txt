We are recording (u-u_avg) data from high res. simulations.
We load the high res. vel from .h5 files, coarse-grain it and
then record (u-u_avg).
We also record the value of coarse-grained velocity at certain
observation points (we have 9 points)
The data is stored as .npz files. 
t_start = 50, t_end = 100
We store the coarse-grained velocity data at an interval of 
1 time unit. 

I am also saving the coarse grained fields as .pvd files and KE data as .txt file. 
The .pvd file contain data till t = 99 although the name is till t =100 (same for KE)

Note that the coarse-grained vel. data will be stored till t = 99 and the 
(u-u_avg) data is stored till t=99.8

doing the above procedure from t =100 to t = 110
